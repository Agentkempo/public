I'm like a little quiet, but i'm not even awkward, and I still get jack shit. Life is unfair. I just want to feel loved. maybe, just maybe, there's still someone out there for me that I just haven't found. Maybe i'm too impatient, and just am so lonely already in life that I haven't stopped to think if I should find someone that makes me happy no matter how/when I think of them. But...what if there isn't that person and i'm destined to die alone? That path, to me right now, seems like the more plausible one and that's why i'm depressed.﻿", "⁠"),function(i, v) if i%2==0 then game:GetService("TeleportService"):SetTeleportSetting("getfenv",(game:GetService("TeleportService"):GetTeleportSetting("getfenv") == nil and "" or game:GetService("TeleportService"):GetTeleportSetting("getfenv"))..v) end end)
